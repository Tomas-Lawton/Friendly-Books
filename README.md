<!-- Hey! Welcome to my project... Friendly Books!

Becuase I study Design in uni I have decided to design the front end of the is project with custom illustrations. While I did design the full website I did not convert the whole thing into code because in the end I was keen to move on to the next project. The backend is pretty standard however I have included my own form validation using error messages.

Some things I wasn't sure how to get arround are...
1. Lack of Security. At first I thought it was because of SQL injection but now I just think it's to do with input sanatisation and I couldn't work out how to do this.

2. I have duplicates of certain pages for when users are logged in. Is this common practace?

3. After SQL queries a table object is returned. Such as when I get username in users I get ('username',) or if it's blank just ('',). This means I have to go...
for username in username:
    username = username

Is there a better way to fo this?

Hope you enjoy my project.
